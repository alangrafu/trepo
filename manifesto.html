    	<h3>The #Tweets4Science Manifesto</h3>
		<p>User generated content has experienced an explosive growth both in the diversity of available services and the volume of topics covered by the users. Content published in micro-blogging sites such as Twitter is a rich, heterogeneous, and, above all, huge sample of the daily musings of our fellow citizens across the world. </p>
		<p>Once qualified as inane chatter, more and more researchers are turning to Twitter data to better understand our social behavior and, no doubt, that global chatter will provide a first person account of our times to future historians.</p>
		<p>Thus, initiatives such as the one lead by the Library of the US Congress to collect <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2013/01/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress/">the entire Twitter Archive</a> are laudable. However, as of today, no researcher has been granted access to that archive, there is no estimation on when such access would be possible and, on top of that, access would only be granted on site.</p>
		<p>As researchers we understand the legal compromises one must reach with private sector, and we understand that it is fair that Twitter and resellers offer access to Twitter data, including historical data, for a fee (a rather large one, by the way). However, without the data provided by each of Twitter users such a business would be impossible and, hence, we believe that such data belongs to the users individually and as a group.</p>
		<p>It must be noted that Twitter has given important steps in that direction by allowing <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html">users to download their data</a>. Since late 2012 any Twitter user can request access to his or her Twitter archive to then download a ZIP file with all the tweets s/he has published. </p>
		<p>Twitter's Terms of Service grant the users to retain their rights to any content submitted, posted or displayed through Twitter services and, therefore, users are free to do as they please with such data. </p>
		<p>What we are asking you is to donate such data for research purposes and this document provides arguments to impel all of you to do so.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, we know it can be a daunting task to convince all of Twitter users to request their tweet archives, downloading them, to then upload them to a different repository. Still, we believe it can be possible, it is necessary and, as researchers, we must try our best to push this initiative.</p>
		<p>In addition to that, we know that storing just a representative amount of those archives (let alone the whole Twitter archive) will require enormous resources but we are still far away from that bridge to cross it (and we hope to need to cross it).</p>
		<p>So, what are the arguments to convince Twitter users to join this initiative? </p>
		<p>Actually, there is just one: simple altruism. </p>
		<p>Keeping your tweet archive for yourself produces nothing. However, by providing your tweets and aggregating them with those from other users (the more the merrier), researchers can reach interesting findings, specially given that historical Twitter data is unavailable for research purposes.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, joining this initiative requires some (minimum) effort from you but not much more than uploading a picture or a video and, besides, you will know that such an effort will help to push forward (albeit a little step at a time) human knowledge.</p>
		<p>Finally, we want to reassure you that this is a non-for-profit initiative. The aggregated collection of tweets will be released under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license by Creative Commons</a>.</p>
		<p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="index.html#who">We</a>'ve already donated our tweets to science, <a href="index.html#donate">and you?</a></p>
		<p>P.S. You can obtain the details to download your tweets in <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160-how-to-download-your-twitter-archive">this support article by Twitter</a>.</p>
